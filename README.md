# MQC_Imaging_CRISTINA

Multi-quantum sodium imaging offers additional insights compared to standard single-quantum (SQ) images with information beyond tissue
sodium concentration (TSC). The characteristic temporal evolution of the SQ and triple quantum (TQ) sodium is of interest. A multi-echo 2D Cartesian Imaging sequence for SQ and TQ 23Na (CRISTINA) Phantom raw data, acquired at 7T (Siemens Magnetom , Erlangen, Germany) can be downloaded along with the reconstruction.
