# MQC_Imaging_CRISTINA

Multi-quantum sodium imaging offers additional insights compared to standard single-quantum (SQ) images with information beyond tissue
sodium concentration (TSC). The characteristic temporal evolution of the SQ and triple quantum (TQ) sodium is of interest and a multi echo sequence for SQ and TQ signal acquisition was developed: CRISTINA. Phantom raw data can be downloaded along with the reconstruction.
